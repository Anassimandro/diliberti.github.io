		<p><b>Syllabus.</b> (1) Foundational aspects of the Yoneda Embedding. (2) Lawvere theories and Universal Algebra. (3) Sketches and Accessible Categories. (4) Hyperdoctrines. (5) Type Theories. (6) Topoi as spaces, sets and theories.</p> 

    <p><b>Description.</b> Categorical logic emerged in the Category Theory community after the impulse of Bill Lawvere and succeeded in providing a crisper, sharper, and authentically foundational point of view on mathematical logic. Because of its versatility, the diversity and richness of perspectives, and the historical dilution in several communities (theoretical computer science, model theory, proof theory), its initial unity has taken off in the last years, and often students are only introduced to some aspects of this <i>elephant</i>. This course presents a unified point of view on the most prominent topics of Categorical Logic. It's a safari in the territories of categorical foundations of mathematics, stressing on the dissolution of their borders.</p>

    <p><b>Relevance and Impact.</b> All the topics above have proven to have horizontal applications in Logic and Theoretical computer science. Lawvere theories have offered a concrete way to handle algebraic effects since the work of Plotkin and Moggi, their relation to monads has later impacted the design of modern programming languages like Haskell after Walder. The theory of Accessible Categories is the most used framework for categorical model theory, and its versatility has found applications even in algebraic topology via algebraic factorization systems. Hyperdoctrines perfectly capture first order logic, and their idea has inspired Benabou's treatment of fibrations to later deliver Jacob's approach to type theories et similia. Finally, topos theory has pervasive ramifications in mathematics, being motivated from plain geometry and allowing to represent geometric theories (which include coherent and thus first order logic). </p>

     <p><b>Audience.</b> The course is designed master and Ph.D. students interested in foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer science in a broad sense. A good knowledge of the language of category theory will be a prerequisite for the audience (the equivalent of the book by Riehl in bibliography), yet we will re-discover some of its content from a more foundational perspective. </p>

<p><b>Comments.</b> The course is - of course - very dense, and has no intention of completely cover the bibliography above. Instead, one of its main intents is to introduce the students to this corpus of knowledge, making sure that they reach a sufficient level of independence and maturity. It is my intention to provide lecture notes for each lecture, at least to help the student to better navigate the literature.</p>
